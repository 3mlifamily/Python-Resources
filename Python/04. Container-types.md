# Containers

## Preface

The word "container" is rarely mentioned in Python technical articles. When you see "container", most people think of the little blue whale: *Docker*, but this article has nothing to do with it. A container is an abstract concept in Python, and is a general term for data types that are specifically used to hold other objects.

In Python, there are four most common types of built-in containers: `list`, `tuple`, `dict` and `set`. By using them individually or in combination, many things can be accomplished efficiently.

The internal implementation details of the Python language itself are also closely related to these container types. For example, Python class instance attributes, global variables `globals()`, etc. are all stored by dictionary type.

In this article, I will start with the definition of the container type and try to summarize some of the best practices of daily coding. After that, I will share some programming tips around the special functions provided by each container type.


### When we talk about containers, what are we talking about?

I gave a simple definition of "container" in the front: *The container that is used to hold other objects is the container*. But this definition is too broad to provide any guidance value for our daily programming. To truly master the containers in Python, you need to start from two levels:

- **Low-level implementation**: What data structure is used by the built-in container type? How does an operation work?
- **High-level abstraction**: What determines whether an object is a container? What behaviors define containers?

Below, let us stand on these two different levels and re-understand the container.


## Look at the bottom of the container

Python is a high-level programming language, **the built-in container types it provides are all highly encapsulated and abstract results**. Compared with the names "linked list", "red-black tree", and "hash table", the names of all Python built-in types only describe the functional characteristics of this type, and others can't understand them only by these names. Even a little bit of internal details.

This is one of the advantages of the Python programming language. Compared with programming languages ​​such as C, which are closer to the bottom of the computer, Python has redesigned and implemented a programmer-friendly built-in container type, shielding additional work such as memory management. Provide us with a better development experience.

But if this is the advantage of the Python language, why should we bother to understand the implementation details of the container type? The answer is: **Attention to detail can help us write faster code.**

### Write faster code

#### 1. Avoid frequently expanding lists/creating new lists

All built-in container types do not limit capacity. If you want, you can keep stuffing the increasing numbers into an empty list and eventually burst the entire machine's memory.

In the implementation details of the Python language, the memory of the list is allocated on demand. When the memory currently owned by a list is not enough, the memory expansion logic will be triggered. And allocating memory is an expensive operation. Although in most cases, it will not have any serious impact on the performance of your program. But when the amount of data you process is particularly large, it is easy to drag the performance of the entire program because of memory allocation.

Fortunately, Python has been aware of this problem for a long time, and provided an official problem-solving guide, that is: **"Lazy"**.

How to explain "to be lazy"? The evolution of the `range()` function is a very good example.

In Python 2, if you call `range(100000000)`, you need to wait a few seconds to get the result, because it needs to return a huge list, and spends a lot of time on memory allocation and calculation. But in Python 3, the same call will immediately get the result. Because what the function returns is no longer a list, but a lazy object of type `range`, it will return you the real number only when you iterate it or slice it.

**So, in order to improve performance, the built-in function `range` becomes “lazy”.** And in order to avoid too frequent memory allocation, in daily coding, our function also needs to become lazy, this includes:

- More use of the yield keyword to return generator objects
- Try to use generator expressions instead of list comprehension expressions
    - Generator expression: `(i for i in range(100))` 👍
    - List derivation expression: `[i for i in range(100)]`
-Try to use lazy objects provided by the module:
    - Use `re.finditer` instead of `re.findall`
    - Use iterable file objects directly: `for line in fp` instead of `for line in fp.readlines()`

#### 2. Use the deque module in scenes with many operations at the head of the list

The list is implemented based on the array structure (Array), when you insert a new member (`list.insert(0, item)`) at the head of the list, all other members behind it need to be moved, the operation time is complicated The degree is `O(n)`. This makes inserting members at the head of the list much slower than appending at the end (`list.append(item)` time complexity is `O(1)`).

If your code needs to perform such operations many times, consider using the [collections.deque](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/collections.html#collections.deque) type instead of lists. Because deque is implemented based on a double-ended queue, whether it is appending elements at the head or the tail, the time complexity is `O(1)`.

#### 3. Use collections/dictionaries to determine whether members exist

When you need to determine whether a member exists in a container, it is more appropriate to use a collection than a list. Because the time complexity of `item in [...]` operations is `O(n)`, and the time complexity of `item in {...}` is `O(1)`. This is because dictionaries and collections are implemented based on Hash Table data structures.

```python
# This example is not particularly appropriate, because when the target collection is particularly small, the effect of using the collection or the list on the efficiency is minimal
# But this is not the point :)
VALID_NAMES = ["piglei", "raymond", "bojack", "caroline"]

# Convert to a collection type specifically for member judgment
VALID_NAMES_SET = set(VALID_NAMES)


def validate_name(name):
    if name not in VALID_NAMES_SET:
        # The f-strings feature added by Python 3.6 is used here
        raise ValueError(f"{name} is not a valid name!")
```

## Looking at the container

Python is a "[duck type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing)" language: *"When you see a bird walking like a duck, swimming like a duck, and calling like a duck , Then this bird can be called a duck."* So, when we say what type an object is, it basically refers to: **This object meets the specific interface specification of that type and can be Use as this type. ** The same is true for all built-in container types.

Open [abc](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html) located under the [collections](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/collections.html) module )*(Acronym for "Abstract Base Classes")* Submodule, you can find all the container-related interfaces (abstract classes) definitions. Let's take a look at the interfaces that those built-in container types satisfy:

- **List (list)**: meet the interfaces of `Iterable`, `Sequence`, `MutableSequence`, etc.
- **Tuple (tuple)**: satisfy `Iterable`, `Sequence`
- **Dictionary (dict)**: Meet `Iterable`, `Mapping`, `MutableMapping` [[Note 3]]
- **Set**: satisfy `Iterable`, `Set`, `MutableSet`

Each built-in container type is actually a combined entity that satisfies multiple interface definitions. For example, all container types satisfy the "Iterable" interface, which means that they are all "iterable". But conversely, not all "iterable" objects are containers. Just like a string can be iterated, we usually don't think of it as a "container".

After understanding this fact, we will **recognize** one of the most important principles of object-oriented programming in Python: **programming towards interfaces rather than concrete implementations.**

Let's use an example to see how to understand "interface-oriented programming" in Python.

### Write more scalable code

One day, we received a request: *There is a list containing many user comments. In order to display on the page normally, all comments exceeding a certain length need to be replaced with ellipses*.

This requirement is easy to do, and soon we wrote the first version of the code:

```python
# Note: In order to enhance the illustrative nature of the sample code, some code snippets in this article use Python 3.5
# Version added Type Hinting feature

def add_ellipsis(comments: typing.List[str], max_length: int = 12):
    """If the content in the comment list exceeds max_length, the remaining characters are replaced with ellipses
    """
    index = 0
    for comment in comments:
        comment = comment.strip()
        if len(comment)> max_length:
            comments[index] = comment[:max_length] +'...'
        index += 1
    return comments


comments = [
    "Implementation note",
    "Changed",
    "ABC for generator",
]
print("\n".join(add_ellipsis(comments)))
# OUTPUT:
# Implementati...
# Changed
# ABC for gene...
```

In the above code, the `add_ellipsis` function takes a list as a parameter, and then iterates through it, replacing the members that need to be modified. All this seems reasonable, because the most original demand we received was: "There is a **list**, inside...". **But if one day, the comments we get are no longer in the list, but in immutable tuples? **

In that case, the existing function design will force us to write `add_ellipsis(list(comments))` which is slow and ugly code. 😨

#### Container interface programming

We need to improve the function to avoid this problem. Because the `add_ellipsis` function strongly depends on the list type, so when the parameter type becomes a tuple, the current function is no longer applicable *(reason: the type of `Comments[index]` will throw a `TypeError` exception ).* How to improve the design of this part? The secret is: **Let functions rely on the abstract concept of "iterable objects" rather than entity list types.**

Using the generator feature, the function can be changed to this:

```python
def add_ellipsis_gen(comments: typing.Iterable[str], max_length: int = 12):
    """If the content in the iterable comment exceeds max_length, the remaining characters are replaced with ellipses
    """
    for comment in comments:
        comment = comment.strip()
        if len(comment)> max_length:
            yield comment[:max_length] +'...'
        else:
            yield comment


print("\n".join(add_ellipsis_gen(comments)))
```

In the new function, we changed the dependent parameter type from a list to an iterable abstract class. There are many benefits to doing this, one of the most obvious is that whether the comment is from a list, tuple, or a certain file, the new function can be easily satisfied:

```python
# Handle comments placed in tuples
comments = ("Implementation note", "Changed", "ABC for generator")
print("\n".join(add_ellipsis_gen(comments)))

# Handle comments placed in the file
with open("comments") as fp:
    for comment in add_ellipsis_gen(fp):
        print(comment)
```

After changing the dependency from a specific container type to an abstract interface, the applicability of the function becomes wider. In addition, the new function also has advantages in execution efficiency and other aspects. Now let us return to the previous question. ** From a high-level perspective, what defines a container? **

The answer is: **The interface protocol implemented by each container type defines the container. ** In our eyes, different container types should be a combination of various features such as `can iterate`, `can it be modified`, `is there a length? When writing relevant code, we need to pay more attention to the abstract properties of the container rather than the container type itself, which can help us write more elegant and scalable code.

> Hint: In [itertools](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html) and [more-itertools](https://pypi.org/project/more-itertools/) modules You can find more treasures about handling iterable objects.

## Common Tips

### 1. Use tuples to improve branch code

Sometimes, more than three branches of `if/else` will appear in our code. Just like this:

```python
import time


def from_now(ts):
    """ Receive a past timestamp and return a relative time text description from the current time
    """
    now = time.time()
    seconds_delta = int(now-ts)
    if seconds_delta <1:
        return "less than 1 second ago"
    elif seconds_delta <60:
        return "{} seconds ago".format(seconds_delta)
    elif seconds_delta <3600:
        return "{} minutes ago".format(seconds_delta // 60)
    elif seconds_delta <3600 * 24:
        return "{} hours ago".format(seconds_delta // 3600)
    else:
        return "{} days ago".format(seconds_delta // (3600 * 24))


now = time.time()
print(from_now(now))
print(from_now(now-24))
print(from_now(now-600))
print(from_now(now-7500))
print(from_now(now-87500))
# OUTPUT:
# less than 1 second ago
# 24 seconds ago
# 10 minutes ago
# 2 hours ago
# 1 days ago
```

The above function can not pick out too many problems, many people will write similar code. However, if you look closely at it, you can find some obvious "**boundaries**" in the branch code section. For example, when the function determines whether a certain time should be displayed in "seconds", `60` is used. When judging whether minutes should be used, `3600` was used.

**Refining the rules from the boundary is the key to optimizing this code.** If we put all these boundaries in an ordered tuple, then cooperate with the binary search module [bisect](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/bisect.html). The control flow of the entire function can be greatly simplified:

```python
import bisect


# BREAKPOINTS must be sorted, otherwise binary search is not possible
BREAKPOINTS = (1, 60, 3600, 3600 * 24)
TMPLS = (
    # unit, template
    (1, "less than 1 second ago"),
    (1, "{units} seconds ago"),
    (60, "{units} minutes ago"),
    (3600, "{units} hours ago"),
    (3600 * 24, "{units} days ago"),
)


def from_now(ts):
    """ Receive a past timestamp and return a relative time text description from the current time
    """
    seconds_delta = int(time.time()-ts)
    unit, tmpl = TMPLS[bisect.bisect(BREAKPOINTS, seconds_delta)]
    return tmpl.format(units=seconds_delta // unit)
```

In addition to using tuples to optimize too many `if/else` branches, in some cases dictionaries can also be used to do the same thing. The key is to find repetitive logic and laws from the existing code and try a lot.

### 2. Use dynamic unpacking in more places

The dynamic unpacking operation refers to the act of "unwrapping" an iterable object using the `*` or `**` operator. In the Python 2 era, this operation can only be used in the function parameter part, and the order and number of occurrences There are very strict requirements, and the usage scenario is very simple.

```python
def calc(a, b, multiplier=1):
    return (a + b) * multiplier


# Python2 only supports dynamic unpacking in the function parameter section
print calc(*[1, 2], **{"multiplier": 10})
# OUTPUT: 30
```

However, after Python 3, especially the 3.5 version, the usage scenarios of `*` and `**` have been greatly expanded. For example, in Python 2, if we need to merge two dictionaries, we need to do this:

```python
def merge_dict(d1, d2):
    # Because the dictionary is an object that can be modified, in order to avoid modifying the original object, a shallow copy of d1 needs to be copied here
    result = d1.copy()
    result.update(d2)
    return result

user = merge_dict({"name": "piglei"}, {"movies": ["Fight Club"]})
```

But in Python 3.5 and later, you can use the `**` operator to quickly complete the dictionary merge operation:

```
user = {**{"name": "piglei"}, **{"movies": ["Fight Club"]}}
```

In addition, you can also use the `*` operator in ordinary assignment statements to dynamically unpack iterable objects. If you want to learn more about related content, you can read the recommended PEP below.

> Hint: Two PEPs that promote the expansion of dynamic unpacking scenarios:
> - [PEP 3132 - Extended Iterable Unpacking | Python.org](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3132/)
> - [PEP 448 - Additional Unpacking Generalizations | Python.org](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0448/)

### 3. It is better not to use "acquire permission" and "require forgiveness"

This subheading may be a little confusing, let me explain briefly: "acquiring permission" and "requiring forgiveness" are two different programming styles. If we use a classic requirement: "Count the number of occurrences of each element in the list" as an example, two different styles of code would look like this:

```python
# AF: Ask for Forgiveness
# Just do it, if it throws an exception, then handle the exception
def counter_af(l):
    result = {}
    for key in l:
        try:
            result[key] += 1
        except KeyError:
            result[key] = 1
    return result


# AP: Ask for Permission
# Before doing, ask if you can do it, you can do it again
def counter_ap(l):
    result = {}
    for key in l:
        if key in result:
            result[key] += 1
        else:
            result[key] = 1
    return result
```

The entire Python community has a clear preference for the first *Ask for Forgiveness* exception-catch programming style. There are many reasons for this. First, throwing an exception in Python is a very lightweight operation. Second, the first approach is also better than the second in terms of performance, because it does not need to do an additional member check every time it loops.

However, the two pieces of code in the example are very rare in the real world. why? Because if you want to count the number of times, just use `collections.defaultdict` directly:

```python
from collections import defaultdict


def counter_by_collections(l):
    result = defaultdict(int)
    for key in l:
        result[key] += 1
    return result
```

Such code does not require "acquiring permission" nor "request for forgiveness". **The control flow of the entire code becomes clearer and more natural.** So, if possible, please try to omit those **non-core** exception catching logic. Some tips:

- When manipulating dictionary members: use `collections.defaultdict` type
    - Or use `dict[key] = dict.setdefault(key, 0) + 1` built-in function
- If you remove a dictionary member, don't care if it exists:
    - Set the default value when calling the pop function, such as `dict.pop(key, None)`
- Specify the default value when obtaining members in the dictionary: `dict.get(key, default_value)`
- Non-existent slice access to the list will not throw `IndexError` exception: `["foo"][100:200]`

### 4. Use next() function

`next()` is a very useful built-in function that takes an iterator as a parameter and returns the next element of the iterator. Using it with generator expressions, you can efficiently implement requirements such as *"find the first member from the list that meets the criteria"*.

```python
numbers = [3, 7, 8, 2, 21]
# Get and **return immediately** the first even number in the list
print(next(i for i in numbers if i% 2 == 0))
# OUTPUT: 8
```

### 5. Use an ordered dictionary to deduplicate

The structural characteristics of dictionaries and collections ensure that their members are not duplicated, so they are often used for deduplication. However, the result of using these two deduplication will lose the order of the original list. This is determined by the characteristics of the underlying data structure "Hash Table".

```python
>>> l = [10, 2, 3, 21, 10, 3]
# Deduplication but lost order
>>> set(l)
{3, 10, 2, 21}
```

What if you need to remove duplicates and you must preserve order? We can use the `collections.OrderedDict` module:

```python
>>> from collections import OrderedDict
>>> list(OrderedDict.fromkeys(l).keys())
[10, 2, 3, 21]
```

> Hint: In Python 3.6, the default dictionary type changed the way of implementation, and it has become ordered. And in Python 3.7, this feature has changed from **language implementation details** to **reliable official language features**.
>
> But I think it will take some time to get the entire Python community accustomed to this, after all, "the dictionary is unordered" is still printed on countless Python books. Therefore, I still recommend using OrderedDict wherever an ordered dictionary is needed.

## Common Misunderstandings

### 1. Beware of exhausted iterators

Earlier in the article, we mentioned the benefits of using "lazy" generators. However, everything has its two sides. One of the biggest disadvantages of the generator is: **it will dry up**. After you have traversed them completely, you will not get any new content after repeated traversal.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
numbers = (i * 2 for i in numbers)

# The first loop will output 2, 4, 6
for number in numbers:
    print(number)

# Nothing will be output in this loop because the iterator is exhausted
for number in numbers:
    print(number)
```

And not only generator expressions, the built-in functions of map and filter in Python 3 have the same characteristics. Ignoring this feature can easily lead to some undetectable bugs in the code.

Instagram encountered this problem during the migration of the project from Python 2 to Python 3. They shared the story of dealing with this problem at PyCon 2017. Visit the article [Summary of Instagram's speech at PyCon 2017](https://www.zlovezl.cn/articles/instagram-pycon-2017/) and search for "Iterator" to see the details.

### 2. Don't modify the iterated object in the loop body

This is a mistake many Python beginners will make. For example, we need a function to delete all even numbers in the list:

```python
def remove_even(numbers):
    """Remove all even numbers in the list
    """
    for i, number in enumerate(numbers):
        if number% 2 == 0:
            # Problematic code
            del numbers[i]


numbers = [1, 2, 7, 4, 8, 11]
remove_even(numbers)
print(numbers)
# OUTPUT: [1, 7, 8, 11]
```

Notice the extra "8" in the result? When you modify a list while iterating through it, something like this will appear. Because the iterated object `numbers` was modified during the loop. **The traversed subscript is growing, and the length of the list itself is shrinking at the same time. This will cause some members of the list not to be traversed at all. **

So for such operations, please use a new empty list to save the result, or use yield to return a generator. Instead of modifying the list being iterated or the dictionary object itself.

## to sum up

In this article, we first start from the definition of "container type" and discuss the container type at the bottom and high levels. After following the tradition of a series of articles, some tips for writing container-related code are provided.

Let us conclude with the main points:

- Understand the low-level implementation of container types, which can help you write better performance code
- Refine abstract concepts in requirements, oriented towards interfaces instead of programming
- Use more "lazy" objects and less "urgent" lists
- Using tuples and dictionaries can simplify branch code structure
- Using `next()` function with iterator can accomplish many things efficiently, but also need to pay attention to the "exhaustion" problem
- There are a lot of useful tools in the collections and itertools modules. Go check it out!
